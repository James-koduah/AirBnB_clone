# Scope

**AirBnB** is a *complete web application*, integrating database storage, a back-end API and a front-end interface.

The project is in four parts. Each part handles different aspects of Wb development.
This first section deals with building the `console` that will act as a command line interpreter to manipulate data (no visual interface yet, perfect for development and debugging.

- The second section will be the front-end.
- The third section will be the database management system
- The last section will be the API.
